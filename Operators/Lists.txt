Special Operators
There are some special mathematical operators. First, you can combine any of the basic mathematical operators with an assignment operator:

+= - Add and assign operator
-= - Subtract and assign operator
*= - Multiply and assign operator
/= - Divide and assign operator
%= - Modulo and assign operator
Each of these operators serves as a shorthand for a longer operation. Let's assume that we have int x = 1;:

x += 1; Is equivalent to: x = x + 1; - Reassign x to be the result of x + 1
x -= 1; Is equivalent to: x = x - 1; - Reassign x to be the result of x - 1
x *= 2; Is equivalent to: x = x * 2; - Reassign x to be the result of x * 2
x /= 2; Is equivalent to: x = x / 2; - Reassign x to be the result of x / 2
x %= 2; Is equivalent to: x = x % 2; - Reassign x to be the result of x % 2
There are two more special operators you will use alot:

++ - Increment by 1
-- - Decrement by 1
Assuming we have int x = 1; again:

x++ Is equivalent to: x += 1 Which is also equivalent to x = x + 1
x-- Is equivalent to: x -= 1 Which is also equivalent to x = x - 1
